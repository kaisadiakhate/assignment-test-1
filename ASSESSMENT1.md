## Bug ticket #6341

Hello from the QA team,

We got an user complaint from a person called _Mikiko Toyoda_. She complains that she can't get payments through our system.

We suspect that it's because she doesn't have a middle name, and thus the object check fails. I added a skipped test to `payment-01.test.js`. Could you:

1. unskip the middle name test
2. fix the code
3. rerun the tests and check that it passes

## Feature request #6342

According to previous discussion, we are dropping support for Amex cards. I added a skipped test to `payment-01.test.js`. Please unskip the test and fix the code accordingly.

1. unskip the Amex card test
2. fix the code
3. rerun the tests and check that it passes

## Bug ticket #6343

Someone is trying to be funny and hack our system with negative payments. Luckily our API catches those, but it would be best if we'd also check for those. I added a skipped test to `payment-01.test.js`. Could you:

1. unskip the invalid payment object test
2. fix the code
3. rerun the tests and check that it passes
